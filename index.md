* Each stack can have **up to 3 chips**
* Players **cannot peek**/see under the topmost chip on each stack
* On each round, a player has to make **one and only one move**:
    * **Add** one of their own chips to the table, on top of any stack (remember, no more than 3 chips per stack!)
    * Move one chip (**their own or opoonent's**) from one stack to another, **except**:
        * Players **cannot move the chip most recently moved** by their opponent
        * If there are **less than 3 stacks** on the table, the player **has to add a chip** to the table, on any stack
